# Spotify-Search-Project
Description: An interface that allows users to search their favorite artists and albums by making AJAX calls to Spotify's API via a proxy. Clicking any search result will redirect the user to the related artist/album's Spotify page.

Personal Notes: This was my first project using a REST API (Spotify) requiring authentication to make an ajax request. Additionally, I implemented an infinite scroll functionality triggering a new ajax request before the user reaches the bottom.
